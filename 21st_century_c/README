All examples from the book are contained here. Some changes had to be made to
some of the examples, mainly for style (minor), differences between platforms
and simplifications.

All examples are compilable and testable. Each directory contains examples from
the chapter it's named after and they all have Makefiles to build and test each
example.

The only exception is chapter 12, which requires libapophenia. In order to keep
this repository simple, it was decided not to include the entire library. So,
to compile and test the gsl_distance example, the library must be obtained and
compiled and the Makefile has to be configured (chapter 11 has libapophenia
dependencies too, but the apropriate files were copied form the library).

When the exception above is dealt with, all examples can be built, tested and
cleaned with a shell commands:

$ for i in {1..12}; do make -C $i; done
$ for i in {1..12}; do make -C $i test; done
$ for i in {1..12}; do make -C $i clean; done
